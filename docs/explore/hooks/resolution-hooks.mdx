# Field resolution hooks

In many cases, it might be desired to perform some aditional action before or after some field is resolved. Most common use-case could be authorization of user.

Hooks are special kind of functions added to field with `@Before` or `@After` decorator.

## `@Before` and `@After` hooks

Let's say we want to send informations about useage of some field of our graphql api to analitycs server. We could achieve that with:

```ts
import { ObjectType, Field, After } from 'decapi'

@ObjectType()
class Person {
  @Field()
  id: number

  @Field()
  @After(() => {
    loggingService.sendLog(`Some user may have been removed`)
  })
  remove(): boolean {
    const isDeleted = userService.removeById(this.id)
    return isDeleted
  }
}
```

## Using resolver informations inside hook function

Arguments passed to resolver are exactly the same, as ones passed to native graphql resolver funtion. Signature of a @Before hook function is

```js
({source, arguments, context, info}) => void | Promise<any>
```

for @After, it is:

```js
(resolvedValue, {source, arguments, context, info}) => void | Promise<any>
```

In case, we'd like to add id of removed user to logs, we'd change our code to:

```ts
@ObjectType()
class Person {
  @Field()
  id: number

  @Field()
  @After((isDeleted, { source }) => {
    if (isDeleted) {
      loggingService.sendLog(`User with id ${this.id} was removed`)
      //loggingService.sendLog(`User with id ${source.id} was removed`) could be used alternatively
    }
  })
  remove(): boolean {
    const isDeleted = userService.removeById(this.id)
    return isDeleted
  }
}
```

## Notes

- If one field has many hooks of the same type - they're executed in parallel.
- Field resolver is not called until all @Before hooks are resolved
