# Object types

Object types are main building block of any graphql schema. In `decapi` - `ObjectType` is equivalent to `GraphQLObjectType`.

To define new object type, decorate any class with `@ObjectType` decorator.

```ts
import { ObjectType } from 'decapi'

@ObjectType()
class MyType {
  // fields will be defined here
}
```

## Fields

Every `ObjectType` must have at least one field. To create new field, decorate any property or method of `ObjectType` class with `@Field` decorator:

```ts
import { ObjectType, Field } from 'decapi'

@ObjectType()
class MyType {
  @Field()
  foo: string

  @Field()
  fooMethod(): string {
    return 'fooMethodResult'
  }
}
```

## Array fields

`ArrayField` is an alias for a `Field` Defined like this:

```ts
  @ArrayField({itemType: MyType})
  foo: MyType[]

  // equivalent to

  @Field({type: [MyType], isNullable: false})
  foo: MyType[]

  // or in Graphql

  foo: [String!]!
```

In real world APIs it's not very likely that you would need to return sparser arrays-99% of APIs return dense arrays.
If you need to return a sparse array you need to use an `@ArrayField` decorator.
Normal `@Field` decorator config does not allow to affect item nullability. Just nullability of the whole array.

## Nested Sub-types

To build nested structure of objects - every field can use another `ObjectType` as it's type

```ts
import { ObjectType, Field } from 'decapi'

@ObjectType()
class Location {
  constructor(lat: number, lng: number) {
    this.lat = lat
    this.lng = lng
  }

  @Field()
  lat: number
  @Field()
  lng: number
}

@ObjectType()
class Restaurant {
  @Field()
  name: string

  @Field()
  location(): Location {
    return new Location(50, 50)
  }
}
```

### Using `castTo`

If you want to just return plain object or object of a different class than the class you're exposing on GQL, you might want to use `castTo`. casTo field is used insted of `type` field.

```ts
@ObjectType()
class Restaurant {
  @Field()
  name: string

  @Field({ castTo: Location })
  location(): Location {
    return { lat: 50, long: 50 }
  }
}
```

NOTE: this will always force any thing you return into the provided class.

## Aliasing a field under a different name in graphql schema

Often you might have a field on your model that you want to expose on your API, but you want to make sort of a API getter for that field. This is easily achieved using a `name` config.

```ts
@ObjectType()
class User {
  readonly id!: string

  @Field({ name: 'id' })
  apiId(): string {
    // this field is now exposed as "id" on GQL-you cna query it by doing a query like {users {id}}
    return 'user_id_' + this.id
  }
}
```

## Circular type references

Often you will want to define circular references. Eg. car has owner, owner has cars which have owner. It's required to assign types in lazy way with arrow functions serving as getters

To do so, we'll use `@Field` with `type` option.

```ts
import { ObjectType, Field } from 'decapi'

@ObjectType()
class Car {
  @Field({ type: () => Person })
  owner() {
    return db.findPersonByCarId(this.id)
  }
  @Field()
  id: number
}

@ObjectType()
class Person {
  @Field()
  id: number
  @Field()
  name: string
  @Field({ type: () => Car })
  car() {
    return db.findCarByOwnerId(this.id)
  }
}
```
