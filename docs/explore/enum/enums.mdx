# Enums

For enums we can work with native Typescript string enums.
It is highly recommended to use only string enums exposed through decapi, because if you just use a regular enum and you forget to specify the type explicitly you will only get back the values as integers which won't be usable by your consumers.
In order to expose the enum, all you need to do is registering the enum with it's name, so schema compiler is aware of it (as under the hood, enum is plain key-value object).

```ts
import { registerEnum } from 'decapi'

enum TaskType {
  DONE = 'DONE',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'IN_PROGRESS',
  FINISHED = 'FINISHED',
  CANCELLED = 'CANCELLED'
}

registerEnum(TaskType, { name: 'TaskType' })
```

Now, to use such enum in query like:

```graphql
query {
  currentUser {
    hasAnyTaskOfType(type: DONE)
  }
}
```

`User` type resolved by `currentUser` would be defined as:

```ts
import { ObjectType, Field } from 'decapi'

@ObjectType()
class User {
  @Field()
  id: number

  @Field()
  hasAnyTaskOfType(@Arg({ type: TaskType }) type: TaskType): boolean {
    return tasksService.hasTasksOfType(type)
  }
}
```

Graphql enum value must match this regex: /^[\_a-zA-Z][_a-za-z0-9]\*\$/

If they don't an error is thrown. We could remove the dashes and carry on, but that would just create an inconsistency in your API and your TS enums.

String Enums that don't have matching keys and values are created using their TS values on graphql. If you need to use keys instead, pass option like this:

```ts
import { registerEnum } from 'decapi'

enum Foo {
  Bar = 'Test',
  Baz = 'Test2'
}

registerEnum(Foo, { name: 'Foo', useKeys: true })
```

results in:

```graphql
enum FooEnum {
  Bar
  Baz
}
```

whereas without `seKeys: true` you get:

```graphql
enum FooEnum {
  Test
  Test2
}
```
