# Enums

For enums we can work with native Typescript string enums.
It is highly recommended to use only string enums exposed through decapi, because if you just use a regular enum and you forget to specify the type explicitly you will only get back the values as integers which won't be usable by your consumers.
In order to expose the enum, all you need to do is registering the enum with it's name, so schema compiler is aware of it (as under the hood, enum is plain key-value object).

```ts
import { registerEnum } from 'decapi'

enum TaskType {
  DONE = 'DONE',
  IN_PROGRESS = 'IN_PROGRESS',
  FINISHED = 'FINISHED',
  CANCELLED = 'CANCELLED'
}

registerEnum(TaskType, { name: 'TaskType' })
```

Now, to use such enum in query like:

```graphql
query {
  currentUser {
    hasAnyTaskOfType(type: DONE)
  }
}
```

`User` type resolved by `currentUser` would be defined as:

```ts
import { ObjectType, Field } from 'decapi'

@ObjectType()
class User {
  @Field()
  id: number

  @Field()
  hasAnyTaskOfType(@Arg({ type: TaskType }) type: TaskType): boolean {
    return tasksService.hasTasksOfType(type)
  }
}
```

Graphql enum value must match this regex: /[\_A-Za-z][_0-9a-za-z]\*/
If they don't GraphQL library removes other characters.
Currently decapi does allow an enum to have a value that does not match and passes it down to GraphQL. It is planned for upcoming version that it will throw if you try to create an enum whose values don't match the regex.
