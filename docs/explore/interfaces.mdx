# Interfaces

When a regular typescript class is not flexible enough, you can implement an interface.
Are kind of like mixins, but their existence is exposed on the GraphQL so they're helpful
when you have collections of entities returned from a field and these have multiple different types, but they have a common set of fields.
Interfaces are slighly more convenient for your API consumers than Unions.

```ts
  @InterfaceType({ description: 'a vehicle interface' })
  abstract class IVehicle {
    @Field({ type: GraphQLInt })
    windows: number

    @Field({ type: GraphQLInt })
    seats: number
  }

  @ObjectType({ implements: IVehicle })
  class Car implements IVehicle {
    windows: number
    seats: number
    @Field()
    wheels: number
  }

  @ObjectType({ implements: IVehicle })
  class Boat implements IVehicle {
    windows: number
    seats: number

    @Field()
    propellers: number
  }

  @SchemaRoot()
  class FooSchema {
    @Query({ type: [IVehicle] })
    vehicles(): IVehicle[] {
      const car = new Car()
      car.seats = 4
      car.windows = 6
      car.wheels = 4

      const boat = new Boat()
      boat.seats = 150
      boat.windows = 30
      return [car, boat]
    }
  }
```

THEN you can query your schema like this:
```
  {
    vehicles {
      seats
      windows
      __typename
      ... on Car {
        wheels
      }
      ... on Boat {
        propellers
      }
    }
  }
```
