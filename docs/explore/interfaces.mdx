# Interfaces

Are kind of like mixins, but their existence is exposed on the GraphQL so they're helpful
when you have collections of entities returned from a field/Query and these have multiple different types, but they have a common set of fields.
Interfaces are slighly more convenient for your API consumers than Unions.

```ts
@InterfaceType({ description: 'a vehicle interface' })
abstract class IVehicle {
  @Field({ type: GraphQLInt })
  windows: number

  @Field({ type: GraphQLInt })
  seats: number
}

@ObjectType({ implements: [IVehicle] })
class Car implements IVehicle {
  windows: number
  seats: number
  @Field()
  wheels: number
}

@ObjectType({ implements: [IVehicle] })
class Boat implements IVehicle {
  windows: number
  seats: number

  @Field()
  propellers: number
}

@SchemaRoot()
class FooSchema {
  @Query({ type: [IVehicle] })
  vehicles(): IVehicle[] {
    const car = new Car()
    car.seats = 4
    car.windows = 6
    car.wheels = 4

    const boat = new Boat()
    boat.seats = 150
    boat.windows = 30
    return [car, boat]
  }
}
```

THEN you can query your schema like this:

```
  {
    vehicles {
      seats
      windows
      __typename
      ... on Car {
        wheels
      }
      ... on Boat {
        propellers
      }
    }
  }
```

NOTE: All your interfaces are stored globally in a singleton `interfaceClassesSet`.
If you need to build more than one schema, it may be wise do `clear()` this Set after you compile
each schema to avoid having all the interfaces in all of your schemas. Import it like this: `import {interfaceClassesSet} from decapi`
